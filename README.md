## description
This project is a web tool that leverages the MeaningCloud API to analyze the sentiment and subjectivity of text from a given URL. The primary focus was on integrating Webpack for module bundling and Jest for testing. The project involved setting up a Node.js environment with Express to handle server requests and manage interactions with the MeaningCloud API. The app retrieves text from a specified URL, analyzes its sentiment (positive or negative), determines its subjectivity (subjective or factual), and displays a text snippet from the article. Webpack was configured to optimize the build process, and Jest was used to ensure the reliability of the code, particularly focusing on testing the API call functionality and error handling scenarios.
